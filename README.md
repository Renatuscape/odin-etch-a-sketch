# Etch-A-Sketch
## [From The Odin Project Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)

In this project, the goal is to create a browser version of an Etch-A-Sketch that works by manipulating the DOM using JavaScript and CSS.

The task specifies that Flexbox, not CSS Grid, should be used to create the grid-layout of the Etch-A-Sketch.

I have chosen to include an erase feature to improve usability as a drawing tool.
